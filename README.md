# Solidity-Contracts
Here is going to be all of the projects/contracts that i have made during my journey with Solidity
# Solidity Practice  

This repo contains my first smart contracts written while learning Solidity.  

## Contracts
- **SimpleStorage.sol** → stores and retrieves a number and has core functionality and operations.  
- **StorageFactory.sol** → deploys new `SimpleStorage` contracts and interacts with them.  

## Notes
These contracts are for practice only:
- Learning deployment
- Using the factory pattern
- Interacting with multiple contracts
